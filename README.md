Overview
This project demonstrates how multi-threading can be used to optimize the performance of various algorithms. By utilizing multiple threads, the aim is to reduce processing time for computationally expensive tasks and increase the efficiency of algorithms that can be parallelized.

The project implements several algorithms, with a focus on demonstrating the performance benefits of multi-threading, particularly in sorting algorithms like Merge Sort.

Key Features
Multi-threading Support: The project employs Java's Thread and ExecutorService to split tasks and run them in parallel.
Improved Performance: A noticeable reduction in execution time when handling large datasets.
Modular Design: Algorithms are designed in a modular fashion to allow easy addition of new multi-threaded optimizations.
Algorithms Implemented
1. Merge Sort (Multi-threaded)
A modified version of Merge Sort that uses multiple threads to sort sub-arrays concurrently.

2. Other Algorithms
Future versions of this project will include other algorithms optimized for multi-threading, such as Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, and more.
